## Catchment Delineation

The model domain was based on the [EcoSHEDS Northeast Catchment Delineation](https://ecosheds.github.io/necd/), which is also used for the [EcoSHEDS Northeast Stream Temperature Model](https://ecosheds.org/models/stream-temperature/latest/). This delineation was created in 2014-2015 to provide a high resolution catchment delineation across the northeast that was spatially consistent over the entire region. The EcoSHEDS delineation was created prior to the completion of the [USGS NHDPlus High Resolution](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution) dataset. Unfortunately, the two delineations are not directly relatable.

Figure \@ref(fig:data-catchments) shows the extent of this delineation, which covers the northeast and mid-Atlantic portions of the eastern U.S. from Maine to Virginia. The delineation includes approximately 450,000 individual catchments, with an mean surface area of 1.6 km^2^.

## HUC8 Basins

The [8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC8)](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html) basins were used to account for regional variations in brook trout occupancy that was not explained by stream temperature data (see [Model Structure]). Figure \@ref(fig:data-huc8) shows the boundary of each HUC8 basin.

      )
```

## Observation Data

Observed presence/absence data of eastern brook trout was gathered from multiple state agencies.

The raw presence/absence observations were aggregated by catchment for input to the model. If there were multiple observations in a single catchment (either at different locations or at different times), then the catchment was assigned to the `presence` category if there was at least presence among those observations. If all observations were absences, then the catchment was assigned to `absence`.

The follow map, figures, and table provide a summary of the observed catchment presence/absence by state.

    across(-c(State, `% Presence`), scales::comma)
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable(align = 'lrrrr')
```

## Stream Temperature

The primary input to the brook trout occupancy model is the estimated mean July stream temperature of each catchment. These estimates were generated using the [EcoSHEDS Northeast Stream Temperature Model](https://ecosheds.org/models/stream-temperature/latest/). The estimated value for each catchment represents the long-term mean July stream temperature computed over all years since 1980. Estimates are only generated for catchments with total cumulative drainage areas less than 200 km^2^ due to the great complexity, anthropogenic impacts, and non-linearities associated with temperature dynamics in larger rivers.

The stream temperature model is based on a linear mixed effects framework that accounts for spatial and temporal correlations using a hierachical Bayesian structure. The primary input variables include air temperature, precipitation, land use (forest, agriculture, high development), impounded drainage area, and total drainage area. See the [stream temperature model documentation](https://ecosheds.org/models/stream-temperature/latest/) for more information.

Figure \@ref(fig:data-temp) shows the estimated mean July stream temperature for each catchment.
