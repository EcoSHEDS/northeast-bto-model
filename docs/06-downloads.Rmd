## Model Predictions

The EcoSHEDS Northeast Brook Trout Occupancy Model predictions can be downloaded as CSV file from the following link.

> **[Brook Trout Occupancy Predictions `r bto_version` (csv)](`r dest_filename`)**

This file contains the following headers:

```{r downloads-columns}
df_columns <- tribble(
  ~column, ~label,
  "featureid","Catchment ID",
  "huc8","HUC8 ID",
  "mean_jul_temp","Mean July Stream Temp. (degC)",
  "occ_current","Occupancy Probability (Historical)",
  "occ_air_2","Occupancy Probability (+2.0 degC Air Temp)",
  "occ_air_4","Occupancy Probability (+4.0 degC Air Temp)",
  "occ_air_6","Occupancy Probability (+6.0 degC Air Temp)",
  "max_air_occ30","Max Air Temp Increase (degC) for 30% Occupancy Probability",
  "max_air_occ50","Max Air Temp Increase (degC) for 50% Occupancy Probability",
  "max_air_occ70","Max Air Temp Increase (degC) for 70% Occupancy Probability"
)

## Catchment Delineation

The [EcoSHEDS Northeast Catchment Delineation](http://conte-ecology.github.io/shedsGisData/) can be downloaded from the following links, which contain shapefiles grouped by HUC2 region. The model predictions dataset can be joined to these shapefiles using the common `featureid` column, which serves as the unique catchment ID.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hydrologic-regions.png")
```
